# ü§ñ InspAIct ‚Äì Intelligent Bottle Defect Detection with PatchCore & MVTec AD

**InspAIct** is a **Streamlit-powered anomaly detection app** that uses the **PatchCore** algorithm to identify manufacturing defects in bottles from the **MVTec AD** dataset.  
It detects issues like cracks, contamination, and broken seals ‚Äî with **heatmap visualizations** to make defects easy to spot.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview

**InspAIct** is designed to assist in **quality control** for bottling lines by providing:
- Fast detection of visual defects
- Clear anomaly localization with heatmaps
- An easy-to-use web interface for real-time inspection

Built on **PatchCore** anomaly detection, this tool focuses on **bottle inspection** but can be extended to other industrial objects from MVTec AD.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Motivation

In the beverage and packaging industry, even minor defects can lead to:
- **Product recalls**
- **Customer dissatisfaction**
- **Increased waste and costs**

Large-scale defect detection systems can be expensive and require specialized hardware.  
**InspAIct** makes **AI-driven inspection** accessible:
- Runs in the cloud or locally
- Minimal setup with a simple Streamlit app
- Uses open-source models and datasets

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Features

- ‚úÖ Detects anomalies in **bottle images**
- üî• Generates **pixel-level anomaly heatmaps**
- üñº Displays **original image** side-by-side with the heatmap
- üìä Shows **predicted label** and **anomaly score**
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployable to **Streamlit Cloud** for instant demo access

## üîü Dataset
   - **Name:** MVTec AD ‚Äì Bottle category
   - **Description:** Contains normal and defective bottle images for anomaly detection.
   - **Source:** https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad
   - **Usage in this project:** Used for evaluating and visualizing PatchCore‚Äôs bottle defect detection performance.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Details

- **Algorithm:** PatchCore (Anomaly detection using patch-based features)  
- **Framework:** PyTorch  
- **Input Size:** Configured for MVTec AD bottle images  
- **Training:** Pre-trained on MVTec AD training split (normal images only)  
- **Inference:** Produces both a binary prediction (Normal/Defective) and a pixel-level anomaly map  

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Results & Examples

| Defect Type  | Example Image | Heatmap | Predicted Label | Anomaly Score |
|--------------|--------------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Broken Large | ![original](results/originals/broken_large/000.png) | ![heatmap](results/broken_large_000.png) | Defective | 0.92 |

The heatmap clearly highlights defect regions, enabling easy visual verification.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Why It Matters

In beverage manufacturing, **quality control** is essential to maintain:
- **Product safety**
- **Customer trust**
- **Regulatory compliance**

Automated defect detection with **InspAIct**:
- Reduces inspection time and costs  
- Minimizes human error in visual inspection  
- Enables quick identification of recurring production issues  

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Future Work / Roadmap

- [ ] Add **real-time image upload** for live scoring  
- [ ] Extend support to **other MVTec AD classes** (e.g., screw, hazelnut, cable)  
- [ ] Implement **batch inference mode**  
- [ ] Generate **detailed PDF reports** of inspection results  
- [ ] Add **user authentication** and session tracking in the app
